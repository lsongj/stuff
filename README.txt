Steps to make this work:

1.) Create a folder in c:\temp named "randomizerFiles"
2.) In the folder, place all the downloaded files from the git
3.) Move the "Randomizer.bat" file (the one with the gears) to the desktop from the folder.


Then, all you have to do is doubleclick the Randomizer.bat file
to start the program.

###Use Notes###

If you want a 33% chance to roll a "difficulty modifier",
click the check box in the bottom right before clicking the big
"roll button"

In order to make the dramatic scrolling effect work during the
choosing, you have to jiggle your mouse around lol.

After it's finished running, there will be a short delay
before the big button becomes active again.
