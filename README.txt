Steps to make this work:

Move the entire "randomizerFiles" folder into the C:\temp path
Move the "Randomizer" .bat file (the one with the gears)
from the randomizerFiles folder, to your desktop.

Then, all you have to do is doubleclick the Randomizer.bat file
to start the program.

If you want a 33% chance to roll a "difficulty modifier",
click the check box in the bottom right before clicking the big
"roll button"

In order to make the dramatic scrolling effect work during the
choosing, you have to jiggle your mouse around lol.

After it's finished running, there will be a short delay
before the big button becomes active again.
